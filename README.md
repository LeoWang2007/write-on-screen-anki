# Sorry...

Due to becoming a member of the school training team, there were too many daily tasks that needed to be done, and I had to postpone the development of this project, which resulted in betraying the trust of too many users.

Recently, I discovered this project: https://github.com/Rytisgit/Anki-StylusDraw, seems to be doing better than me.

I will continue to learn and hope to bring better work to everyone. 
If there is time in the future, perhaps I will continue to develop it...

# 说声抱歉……

由于在学校被选入了训练队，日常需要做的事太多了，我不得不将这个项目的开发工作向后延期，以至于辜负了太多用户的信任。

最近我发现了这个项目： https://github.com/Rytisgit/Anki-StylusDraw ，似乎做的比我更好。

我将继续学习，希望能为大家带来更好的作品。

后续有空也许会继续开发吧……
